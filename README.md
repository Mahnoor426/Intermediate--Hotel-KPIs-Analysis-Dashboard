## ROLE

Perform ETL

Created Dashboard

## DESCRIPTION

Wanted to explore data analysis field and came across best YouTube lectures that help me better transform the data into visuals and give better understanding to business.

I really wanted to help people and let them make better business decisions.

## EXPLANATION OF PROJECT:
-How you chose data that could inform your analysis?
In this task, data and mockup was provided by stakeholder to tell actually how they wanted to the dashboard to look like. They informed us with the important KPI (Revenue, Occupany% and Average Rating) and they wanted to track the data weekly and monthly that is Weekly Trend and Monthly Trend. To make better business decision you need to look at data movement it means Weekly trend or monthly trend.

- Methods you used to analyze the data?Did you perform ETL?
empty or null values were removed. All the currencies were converted into USD to easily generate Revenue.

-Observations and insights being captured from the dashboard?
    - Created some new KPI like RevPar(), DSRN() and ADR()...
    - is occupancy is 100% then RevPar and ADR will be equal. Which is the most ideal state.
    - DSRN is refering to available rooms. DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights).
    - Weekend VS Weekday. To check whether there is higher business on weekends or not.

This hotel doesnot use any pricing strategy taht is it uses fix pricing strategy. The price of hotel lets say was 50,000 on weekday. So since weekend consumes more space so the pricing can be increased more to 80,000 or 75,000. But this hotel pricing remains the same. This analysis is captured through trend of key metrics that revpar is still not fluctuating.
The strategy if pricing they use is flat pricing strategy. Neither dynamic nor weekend/weekday pricing.
